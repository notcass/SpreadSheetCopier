If for some reason anyone is reading this....

This is just a fun little project to automate a really annoying task at my work; Creating a year's worth of
daily spreadsheets, and renaming them to a long specific name.

I'm still fairly new to Java and some of the functions of this program were things I had to google and
implement without much knowledge on. So it's probably a bunch of garbage.


What it does:
Takes a year and root folder and then creates a folder in the root named Audit.
Inside Audit it creates a folder for each month of the year.
Inside each month folder is a copy of a template spreadsheet for each day.
Then it renames them all to that date.

Can be used to make many years of sheets in a matter of seconds.
