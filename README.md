If for some reason anyone is reading this....

This is just a fun little project to automate a really annoying task at my work; Creating a year's worth of
daily spreadsheets, and renaming each of them to a unique name.

I'm still fairly new to Java and some of the functions of this program were things I had to google and
implement without much knowledge on. So it's probably a bunch of garbage.


What it does: 
Copies and renames a template spreadsheet for each day of the year, with 
each sheet's name including that day's date.
